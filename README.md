### Asset Classification with Deep Learning from Computer Added Design Parts
A dissertation submitted by Joshua Garry in the fulfillment of the requirements of ENG4112 Research Project towards the degree of Bachelor of Engineering Mechanical Submitted: October, 2022

### Abstract
In this project an industrial client focused method for asset classification is proposed; where the output of a machine learning algorithm can identify the CAD model corresponding to the subject of the image input. This method aims to use a per part identification system based on the client’s own database as opposed to the norm of general categorical identification. Part of this study also aims to assess the feasibility of the image rendering process used to procure the proposed client machine learning dataset. This dataset would then be used to train a lightweight convolutional neural network model in such a way that could be replicated by an end client. The application of using transfer learning from previously trained models to reduce the training time is also explored. This involved training multiple iterations of classification models and using them as well as existing models from the Google Keras and Tensorflow framework for machine learning. The main test model was made with the base model attached to a head consisting of dense neural network layers. This produced a best result of 13.75 percent accuracy and 18.75 with fine tuning enabled with the Keras ResNet50 model as the transfer learning base. This was also tested on a real world sample set of images to identify if the model could return a relevant result within the top three returned results. This yielded a best result of 55.55 percent accuracy with the model trained with the ResNet50 base, however only 33.33 percent with the same model that had further fine tuning. This in combination with a visual assessment of returned results, gives rise to the main findings that the most influential factor for success in implementing this technique, is the selection of the pretrained model base; as well as the assertion that fine tuning may increase the accuracy on the rendered results yet decrease the context transferability that is incorporated into a pretrained model.


## [Dragline Sync Motor Lifting Jig](https://github.com/00Josh/Portfolio/blob/main/Sync_Motor_Lifting_Jig_Finished.jpg)
Desined a purpos build lifting jig for use in a Marian 8050 dragline. This was designed to meet the tight height and space requirments inside the dragline for use with the onboard gartie craness. This conforms to the Lifting Devices standard AS4991 and AS3990.

## [low Profile Excavator Track Frame Load Roller Change out Jig](https://github.com/00Josh/Portfolio/blob/main/Load_Roller_Change-out_Jig.png)
Designed a track frame load roller change out jig to assist the fittment of the load rollers back into the track frame by allowing for translation and rotation of the cradle while using a forklift or tellyhandeler. The design utilises the low cost and hight relative presition of laser cutting to make this reliable and cost effective. This design has had great success and has been adopted in CQ and WA.

## [DSM Capability Statement](https://github.com/00Josh/Portfolio/blob/main/DSM%20Capability%20Statement.pdf)
Wrote, collaborated with external graphic designers and arranged for printing of capability statement for DSM in time for a trade show. This is a 12 page document effectively communicating DSM’s strengths and competitive advantages for the purpose of increasing revenue by contract jobs. By doing the job myself and outsourcing only the smaller required jobs I saved the company over $1200.

## [Thermal Analysis Assignment Example](https://github.com/00Josh/Portfolio/blob/main/thermal_simulation_assignment.py)
For an Advanced Termodynamics course assignment requring an analysis a verticaly simetrical plate that is simulated through the cross section in steady state. This is in the form of a Python script that can be upscaeled to a finer gridspacing for a better result.

## [Matrix Truss Solver Script](https://github.com/00Josh/Portfolio/blob/main/matrix_truss_solver.m)
This is a simple Matlab script I made when I was studying MEC3302 Computational Mechanics in Design (USQ's FEA course) as a personal side project. This shows a firm understanding of the stiffness method used in calculating simple nodal systems of load transfer. I also made a [2D truss solver script](https://github.com/00Josh/Portfolio/blob/main/beam_with_moments.m) using the stiffness method with caesarian force and displacement.

## FrameCAD Example
FrameCAD is a software package used in conjuction with a CNC rolforming mill to automate steel wall framing production. The software can do 2D FEA as well as work with AutoCAD to add walls to structures. The rollforming machines make the c-sections from coil steel that is fed through rollers.
